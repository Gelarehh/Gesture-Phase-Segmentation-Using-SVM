# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
The SVM model gives a representation of data samples in the form of data points in n-dimensional space.  Thus, the samples fall into various categories, separated by a gap that is as large as possible. In addition to performing linear categorization, SVM can also perform nonlinear categorization efficiently and map inputs to high-dimensional data space, each belonging to a specific category. The SVM builds a model during the training process that assigns new instances to one category or another. What the backup vector machine does is the consideration of an area of ​​definite width that distinguishes data sets.

SVM algorithms use a set of mathematical functions defined as kernels. Their core task is to take the data as input and convert it into the required form. Different SVM algorithms use different types of kernel functions. These functions can have different types: linear, nonlinear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid functions.
